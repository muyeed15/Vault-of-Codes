"""
Let's consider you are paying monthly salary to your employee with bonus for eid. Write a program
/ pseudo-code so that you can correctly calculate the salary for your employee using the following
criteria:
â€œEmployee base salary is 5000 bdt and all employees will get it. If your employee worked overtime,
you would pay 5% extra on their base salary or if the employee sold 300 products, then he will get
10% extra on their base salary. Finally, you will add 8000bdt as bonus for Eid with the calculated
salary to have the final payable amount.
